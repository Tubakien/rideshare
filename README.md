# rideShareWebApp
##Problem Statement
The idea came to me last summer when I saw that other interns at my internship didn't have rides and bussed to work. I had a potential web app project that involved creating a solution to help interns sign up for a ride share and assigned passengers to vehicles. Unfortunately, that didn't come to fruition since it would have taken too long to create. I decided that I would give it a shot for my Individual Project since I liked the idea at the time and I still do now.
